**DelProf3 Coming Soon**<br>
Tuesday, November 11th, 2025<br>
<br>
I am currently working on the 3rd and Final Version (hopefully).<br>
However, I have decided that v3 will consist of a PowerShell Module, containing several Functions, to allow my fellow developers to write custom PowerShell Scripts and so forth.<br>
<br>
At this point, the Module Functions have already been written and I am currently working on Testing/Tweaking. As soon as I am finished, I will post a link to the Repo, where you can find the "Delprof3" PowerShell Module, along with the necessary documentation, Screenshots, Tutorials, etc.<br>
<br>
Thank You,<br>
