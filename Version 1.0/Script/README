- DelProf2.exe
This is the same “DelProf2.exe” version that can be downloaded from the official website.

- Update-NtUserDat.ps1
The “Update-NtUserDat.ps1” contains the actual fix, as it Corrects the Date/Time on the User’s “NTUSER.DAT” File (via the “LastWriteTime” Attribute), by Copying the Date/Time from their “USRCLASS.DAT” File.

- Run_DelProf2_Script.bat
The “Run_DelProf2_Script.bat” Script Runs the “Update-NtUserDat.ps1” (containing the Fix), before Running the “DelProf2.exe” Tool, to Cleanup the Old/Outdated User Accounts (currently Set to Delete Profiles Older than 90 Days).

- Run_DelProf2_Script.vbs
The “Run_DelProf2_Script.vbs” Script simply Runs the “Run_DelProf2_Script.bat” Script, Silently (without displaying any Command Line Windows, etc.).

The actual Fix is implemented by the “Update-NtUserDat.ps1” Script, which loops through All of the User Profiles on the Computer, on which it is Running and Corrects the Date/Time on the associated “NTUSER.DAT” Files (via the “LastWriteTime” Attribute), by Copying the Date/Time from their “USRCLASS.DAT” File (which is Located in the User’s “C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows” Folder).
