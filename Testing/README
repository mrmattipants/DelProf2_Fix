The "Set-TodaysDateOnNtUserDat.ps1" Script can be used to Set the Date/Time on a User's "NTUSER.DAT" File, to the Current Date/Time.

- Set-TodaysDateOnNtUserDat.bat
The “Set-TodaysDateOnNtUserDat.ps1” Script simply Runs the “Set-TodaysDateOnNtUserDat.ps1” Script, with the necessary Parameters & Privileges, etc.

- Update-NtUserDat.ps1

- Test_DelProf2_Script.bat
The “Test_DelProf2_Script.bat” Script Runs the “Update-NtUserDat.ps1” (containing the Fix), before Running the “DelProf2.exe” Tool, in “List Only, Do Not Delete” aka “What-If” Mode (Listing Old/Outdated Profiles without Deleting them).


Testing Instrutions:

1.) Choose the Number of Days that you want to use as the Threshold (the Default is 90 Days).
If you have NOT chosen the Default Threshold (90 Days), Open the "Test_DelProf2_Script.bat" File into your Text Editor of choise and Change the Number 90, on Line #5 ("%~dp0DelProf2.exe" /d:90 /l), to your chosen Number.

2.) Choose a Computer for Testing and Sign into it, using an Administrative Profile.

3.) Choose a User Profile on the chosen Computer for Testing (User Profiles exist under the "C:\Users" Folder).

4.) Check the "UsrClass.dat" File, associated with your Test Profile (under "C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\"), to determine if the "LastWriteDate" Attribute (Labeled as "Last Modified" in Windows Explorer) contains a Date/Time that is older than the chosen threshold (Number of Days).
If necessary, you can utilize the "Set-NewDateOnUsrClassDat" Scripts to Manually Change the "LastWriteTime" Attribute on the "UsrClass.dat" File, associated with the Test Profile.

5.) Check the "NTUser.dat" File, assoicated with your Test Profile (under "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\"), to ensure that the "LastWriteTime" Attribute (Labeled as "Last Modified" in Windows Explorer) contains a Date/Time that is newer than the chosen threshold (Number of Days).
If necessary, you can utilize the "Set-TodaysDateOnNtUserDat" Scripts to Manually Set the "LastWriteTime" Attribute on the "NTUser.dat" File, to the current Date/Time.

6.) Run the "Update-NtUserDat.ps1" Script and Confirm that the "LastWriteTime" Attribute ("Last Modified" in Explorer) on the "NTUser.dat" File has Changed.
The "LastWriteTime" Attribute on the "NTUser.dat" File should now match the "LastWriteTime" Attribute on the "UsrClass.dat" File, exactly.
If the "Last Modified" Date hasn't changed, in the Windows Explorer Window, you may have to Right-Click on the Background of the Windows Explorer Window and Select the "Refresh" Option, from the Context Menu.

7.) Run the "Test_DelProf2_Script" (as Administrator). No Profiles will actually be Deleted, since this is simply a Test.
If the previous Steps were performed correctly, your Test User should be Listed at the bottom, under the Text, that reads "The following user profiles match the deletion criteria".
